Main OOPs concept in java:
1) inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation

Inheritance
is a mechanism to refer functions and fields of parent class to subclasses
It is a process where on class acquires the properties and methods of
another class.

Polymorphism
the ability of the object to take many forms
being able to do multiple functions using same reference variable but
with different objects
process when object can perform actions in different way
There are two types of Polymorphism runtime/dynamic late binding and
compile time early binding or static
we can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading
we can achieve dynamic or runtime binding using method overriding

Abstraction is a process of showing the functionality to the user but hiding the processes
or implementation details behind it
to implement Abstraction abstract.

If we have declared a class as abstract we can not create objects of that class.

Key points
Abstract class
1) can have Abstract and non abstract method
2) can have constructor
3) can have static and instance var, static and non-static methods and fields
4) abstract methods can NOT have static modifier and can NOT be private and we can NOT make them final
5) we can NOT create objects of Abstract Class.
