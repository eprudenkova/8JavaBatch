Abstraction:
is a process of showing the functionality to the user and hiding the implementation details.

We can achieve the abstraction in java in 2 ways:
1)Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces
Abstract ckasses can have abstract methods we can implement those abstract methods
in our child classes.
Rules for follow:
We can have as many abstract methods as we want in a class.
1) To declare an abstracytm method we can use abstract keyword.
2) we can not have abstract methods as private bcs they will never be inheritated
and we will not be able to provide implenetation for those
3) same way we can not declare outr abstract method as final bcs final method can never be overriden

ClassParentClass{
public abstract method1();
}

Interfaces
always have fields as public static and final. Which means we can not change them we can only access them.
