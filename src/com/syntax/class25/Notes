Final

is a keyword in Java that can be used with class field and methods.
If we have declared a class as final class then no other class can inherit our class.

final public class DemoClass{
int number;
demoClass(int number){
this.number=number;
}
void printNumber(){
sout number;
}
}

Public class ChildClass extends DemoClass{
CE //cannot inherit from a final class
}

Benefits of final classes
1)Privacy
2)A<-B<-C<-D... if we have a long chain of classes which have a inheritance relationship
and if we want to restrict this chain we can use the final keyword
Why? because we may waste a lot memory if we do not use these classes properly


4 Pillars of OOPs concept to support programming â€“
abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
They are also known as four pillars of the object oriented programming paradigm.

Abstraction
it is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only important info to the user
in java we have two types of Abstraction
1) using the Absctract class
2) Using the Interfaces
in java so far we have implemented the methods the complete methods where we needed them.
