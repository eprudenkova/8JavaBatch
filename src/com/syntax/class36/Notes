FileHandling in Java

Ways to manipulate the files like property files excel files txt files etc.
Files helps us store our data permanently on the computer hard disc
Files help us separate our data from our code so that every time if we have to change the data
we do not change our code,.
We do not want to change our code with our data because:
1. it introduces bugs
2. we do not want to change one line because whole process of building and deploying the code on different servers
starts over
1) property files
2) Excel files (xlsx)

Property files:
We use property files to store configuration data like Database URLS, usernames, passwords and other configuration
it helps us separate important information from our code and avoid hardcoding

Excel Files
Every time we have duplicate data we should be using the excel files
How to handle Excel files in java
we can handle excel files using apache poi library.

What is an Exception in Java.

Exception is an unwanted behaviour that can cause our programs to terminate abruptly.
How we should handle these unwanted behaviours  we should use try and catch block to handle
these issues

Why prefer try catch over If else condition:
1) we are 100% sure that if anything goes wrong our code will not terminate abruptly
2) It will give us the complete information about the error
3) these exception provide us standard error messages which are same across the industry
