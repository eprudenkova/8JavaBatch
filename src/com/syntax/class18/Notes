Yet another type of variables:

1. Local - A local variable in Java is a variable that's declared within the body of a method.
Then you can use the variable only within that method. Other methods in the class aren't even aware
that the variable exists. Local variables are not given initial default values.
Any variables that is declared inside the methodor a block like while loop for loop if condition
or inside or a constructor.

Properties:
1. we can not access it outside of the block
2. as soon as wea re done with method that local variables are destroyed and memory RAM is freed and available
to be use by other programs witch means they are veru officiant in managing the memory
and that is why they are always recommended over instance variables.

for example
if(2>1){
int x =10; //this var will not be accessible outside the {} of if condition, because of limited scope
}
x=20 CE

2. Instance - an instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors,
methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated,
and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.
Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.

Properties:
1. memory ia allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created and it says
in the memory unless we are done with the closing bracket
2. they are highly discouraged because they are not officiant in handling memory (RAM).

3. Static - they are declared outside of the methods, constructors and block of code with a static keyword

Access modifiers - are just a keyword like private, public, protected that help us reduse
visibility of our variables and methods
so that no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data.

1. private:
if we use private access modifire with our variable or method that
we can only access that variable from the same class

class Account{
private int balance;
private void depositMoney(){
if (boolean properChannel, int money){
balance=balance+money;
}
}
}

class hacker{
balance=1000000;//CE cannot access
}

default:
this is not a keyword, it is a behavior which is assigned to the methods of properties automatically
if we are not assigning any access modifier.

package1
class{
String car;
}

package2
class Family{
car = "I will take you car, I am your brother";
}

if we do not specify any modifiers default behaviour will be assigned to our variables and methods
and they will only be available within the same package.

2. public
if we declare our methods or instance variables we can access them from anywhere any package any class.

package1
public class{
String car;
}

package2
class Family{
car = "I will take you car, I am a random guy";
}
