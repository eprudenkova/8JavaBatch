Class:


For example:
we can have a Car class which can have properties and behaviours
that can be used to build a specific model of car like Toyota/Honda etc

class NameOfClass{
String model;
String make;
String color;
int year;

void drive(){
}
void switchGear(){
}
void applyBreaks(){
}
void drift(){
}
}

In a Class we can have fields, methods, constructors and initializer blocks.
