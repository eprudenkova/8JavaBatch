Inheritance
It is mechanism in java through which we can use the fields and methods
from one class to other class w/o writing a single line of code / repeating the code from the class
from which we are inheriting.

Benefits:
1. Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution.
2. Helps use reduce duplicate code
3. Saves time
4. Reusing the same code again

Disadvatages:
1. classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class

Class Parent{
int money;
void print(){
sout"Money ="+money;
}
}
Class Child extends Parent{
public static void main (String[] args){
Child child = new Child();
child.print();
}
}

Super Keyword
As we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can user super
keyword to access ..
