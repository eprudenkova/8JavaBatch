File handling ib Java
what are files:
Files are mechanism that help us store data permanently on our computer

why we should use file instead of putting the data with code
Every time when we need to make a change
we do not need to redeploy and recompile the code

Steps involved in the compiling and deploying the code:

serves -> Computers that are up all the time they are same as our normal laptop/computer
but with very good hardware.
1. Developers develop the code on development serves performs unit testing deploy this code to QA servers.
2. Testers test the app on the QA server.
3. After QA is done they may deploy the code on Performance, security testing servers
4. Deployment on Staging servers
5. Deployment on UAT servers
6. Deployment on Production servers

To avoid all of these processes we create a configuration file andwe store the configuration in thr file
this configuration file may contain
Usernames passwords URLs to Databases other information for configuration
