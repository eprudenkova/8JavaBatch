Super Keyword
Super is keyword in java that we can use to access immediate parent class members like fields,
methods and constructors.

Method overloading:
1) is a way of utilizing  methods with different parameters but same name
2) allows a class to have more then one method having the same name, if their arguments are different.

In Java we can distinguish different methods by method signature

Method signature is a combination of method name and type of parameters that we are passing as an argument
and the sequence of the parameters.

We can create methods with same name if the parameters to our mthods have the below properties.
1. Method should have different number of parameters

print(){}
print(String name){}
print(String name, String address){}
print(String name, String address, String phone){}

2. We can overload methods if we provide different types of parameters

print(){}
print(String name){}
print(int num){}
print(double salary){}

3. We can also overload our methods if we change the sequence of the parameters

print(String name, int num, char grade){}
print(char grade, String name, int num){}
print(int num, char grade, String name){}

Note:
by changing the return type or the access modifiers we can not overload methods in Java
we can not overload fields!
