3 ways to store the data using java.

1) variables (can store only one value)
2) Arrays (can store multiple objects but they are fixed in size)
3) Collections (can store multiple objects and they are dynamic can grow and shrink the size at runtime)
We can NOT use primitives with collections.
Collections can be used with objects only.

Wrapper Classes:
is a mechanism that allows primitive types to be used as an objects / non primitives

They are classes that help us use collections with our primitive types as they are objects.
They also have many built-in methods to manipulate the data types, e.g. converting a String to an Integer.

String number = "10";
int num = Integer.parseInt(number);

Iterator Interface
is an interface that lets us iterate through any collection,
it's possible because all classes and interfaces inside our collection FW are inheriting from Iterable Interface,
so, they will be having these 3 methods:

hasNext() -- checks if there are any elements left in the collection
next() -- will return the next element from the collection
remove() -- remove method it will remove the element from the collection

All of the collection classes they have a method iterator()
using this method we can get an object of the iterator
and then we can call the 3 methods to iterate or to remove the elements.

Note:
Iterators can be used only ONCE.
Once we have used the iterator we need a new one if we want to iterate the collection again.

ArrayList:
are consecutive (последовательные) memory locations
